"""Editorial pacing metrics: cuts/min, shot length distribution, motion.

Consumes scene-change timestamps (from frames.extract_scene_change) and an
optional list of per-shot motion scores. Produces a JSON blob the reporter
embeds in the editorial profile section.

Talking-head detection is intentionally out-of-scope here — it requires
opencv-python which is not in the skill's preflight. Leaving the field
nullable in the report; can be filled in later if/when opencv is added.
